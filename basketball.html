            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
            opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of
            shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the
            defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m)
            high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team
            from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made
            from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.

                Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by
                passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players
                may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they
                may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense
                or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or
                backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the
                ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling..

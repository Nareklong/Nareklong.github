        <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be
             grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American
              football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby
               league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the
                hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and
                 Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet,
                  and where handling is strictly limited.[10]Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.

           <p>In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10]
             In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal
              must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts
              .There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football"
              . It is widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball")
               refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[12] There is an
                alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to
                 a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[13]
                  There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.

            Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.
            Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under
            organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic
            Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta
            1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games
            is sitting volleyball

            The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as
            follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball
            (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind
            the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's
            court.[3] The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court
            . The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side
            of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.[3] 
            Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an
            attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving
            the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point
            . The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the
            next rally. A few of the most common faults include
